<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Dr. Muriel Prince Warren is a Psychotherapist and Hypnotherapist with nearly 40 years experience in treating individuals, couples, families and groups with a wide range of mental and emotional challenges, particularly trauma and anxiety based disorders.</p>

<p>Her approach to therapy is to provide patients with a safe, supported and confidential environment, that will allow the opportunity to re-experience the critical experiences that have shaped their beliefs about self and have impacted their daily personal and professional interactions. Once addressed patients can create new, positive, healthy responses to the issues that are causing inappropriate and self destructive responses in their lives.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren uniquely combines various techniques to match the individuals needs which she calls Multi-Functional-Therapy. This includes Psychoanalytic-Psychotherapy, Hypnotherapy and Solution-Focused-Therapy. Dr. Warren is experienced in working with patients with various problems such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic-disorder, obsessive compulsion disorders, anger management, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, bi-polar disorders, and weight management.</p>

<p>A renowned speaker and educator, Dr. Warren also provides guidance and therapy through corporate environments. She helps companies create safe, inclusive, and productive work environments through in-house individual and group therapy and advises companies and municipalities on sexual harassment, bullying, and at work trauma scenarios.</p>
